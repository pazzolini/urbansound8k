# Urban Sound Classification 

## Overview

This assignment was part of the **Machine Learning II** course. It explores different neural network architectures including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Final Notebooks

The `Final Notebooks/` directory contains the final versions of our implementation in both Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and HTML formats:

1. **Introduction, Data Understanding and MLP**: Contains project introduction, dataset analysis, and MLP implementation
2. **CNN**: Implementation and analysis of the Convolutional Neural Network model
3. **RNN and Conclusion**: Implementation of various RNN architectures (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU) and project conclusions

## Experimental Work

The `Experiences/` directory contains our experimental notebooks that showcase the development process and various attempts at model optimization:

- **MLP_Experiments.ipynb**
- **CNN_Experiments.ipynb**
- **RNN_Experiments.ipynb**

## Dataset

This project uses the UrbanSound8K dataset, which contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (≤4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes. For more information about the dataset, visit the [official website](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).
